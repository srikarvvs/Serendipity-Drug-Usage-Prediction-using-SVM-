## Serendipity-Drug-Usage-Prediction-using-SVM-

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral.

Sentiment analysis helps data analysts within large enterprises gauge public opinion, conduct nuanced market research, monitor brand and product reputation, and understand customer experience. We trained, and evaluated our models with a UCI ML drug dataset of  describing  drug usage i.e., about 53000 reviews. If patient-reported drug usage the effect could be computationally identified, it could help generate and validate drug-repositioning hypotheses measures can be taken for that drug either in the production or in the usage.

## Project Objectives :

The main objective of this project is Analyze the drug related reviews collected from UCI ML dataset collected from kaggle.com. This analyzation includes usage of classifiers i.e., SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Naive Bayes Machine Learning Algorithms.

The final outcome of this work is to compute three classes or polarities (positive, negative and neutral) from sentiment analysis done on specific drug review posts.

It also help in recommending the Top-5 Drugs for the given condition  and the data is visualized 

It gives Data visualization for polarities on both the classifiers i.e., SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## Results : 

The Accuracy Obtained using the SVM is 98.44% .
The SVM is compared with the Na√Øve Bayes and the SVM performs better than the NB as the accuracy obtained is about 98.12%.
